# RARtrickster Exploit

WinRAR is a very popular compression software developed by RARLAB.<br>

On August 23, 2023, **CVE-2023-38831** was released. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit a flaw in the mechanism that operates when WinRAR version 6.22 or earlier attempts to extract an archive. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute malicious/arbitrary code simply by getting the target to extract a specially crafted archive.

Exploit Stages:
1. The exploit begins by <ins>launching a web server that hosts the WinRAR v6.22 installer</ins>.
2. Then, it <ins>creates a malicious archive file</ins> configured to execute attacker malicious/arbitrary code and prepares it for delivery as the payload.
3. Finally, based on the configured server information, it <ins>automatically generates a deceptive message designed to trick the user</ins> into installing the hosted WinRAR v6.22 installer and extracting the malicious archive.

This exploit ultimately constitutes a **version downgrade attack**, allowing the attacker to carry out the attack by leveraging a previously authorized version of the WinRAR v6.22 software.
